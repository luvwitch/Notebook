## Usage

Upon downloading the necessary files, within the console run the command: 
```bash
npm i
```
This will begin installing the necessary extra packages needed to run the application. They are already defined within the package.json so git will recognize what needs to be specifically installed, saving the user time it would take to install each package individually.

The server will be started by using the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```
Once the server is active, the browser can be opened to the address ' localhost:8080/ ' and the note taking app will be fully functional!


## Demo

The home page of the application looks like this:

Clicking on the "Get Started" button will take you to the notes page.

You can then create a new note or a series of notes which can be viewed and deleted!
